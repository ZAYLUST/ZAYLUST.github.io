        <p>For my career, I want to do something related to  soft ware design, law, and or teaching students in need. I am not sure what career I want to pursue yet, but I know I want to pursue in a career that I enjoy alot. I don’t want to pursue a career that my parents want me to do because I don’t want to regret it later on. I want to try out all the careers that I am interested in first before deciding on choosing a career path. I know that life is never easy and is always full of challenges. However, I will not give up on myself and I will continue to work harder. I want to keep going until i make in this world. </p>
